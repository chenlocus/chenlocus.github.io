I have seen many cases in which Chinese students in Australia were bullied and discriminated.  I feel so pity for these students since they did so much contributions to the Australia society but were rewarded with discrimination by a few Australia people.  Everything has its pros and cons, but why the media always focus on dark side?  I am not going to reckon their intension, but I think it is time to disclose some basic facts to show to the Australia society.

Recently, the Australian Ministry of Education released the latest financial report of an Australian university. According to the report, in 2017, foreign students contributed up to 7.5 billion Australian dollars to Australian universities.



The proportion of tuition to the total university income has risen from 16.3% five years ago to 23.3% at present!



International student fees have become a second largest source of fund in Australia university ( rated after government grants).

Especially in Victoria, this data is even more amazing!

In 2017, the total income of eight Victorian universities was 9.2 billion Australian dollars.



Among them, the fees charged from international students are as high as nearly 2.5 billion Australian dollars, accounting for 27% of total income!



Let's take a look at the data of the University of Melbourne, RMIT University and Monash University, where international students are more congregated.



University of Melbourne:



Total school income in 2017: $2.52 billion

International student tuition: $752 million

Proportion: 30.06%

Monash University:



Total school income in 2017: $2,236 million

International student tuition: $680 million

Proportion: 30.41%

RMIT University:



Total school income in 2017: $1,165 million

International student tuition: $392 million

Proportion: 33.65%

Deakin University:



Total school income in 2017: $1.084 billion

International student tuition: $255 million

Proportion: 23.52%

Except for Deakin University, the income of the other three universities in Melbourne is about 1/3 of the total revenue of the schools.

Put in other words, tuition hold up half of the school!



Now you got to know where the fund came from to build up Clayton campus’s $225 million new teaching building  in Monash university?

What is the source of money to support the creation of the Green Chemical Futures (GCF) green chemical building costing $79.06 million?

Now we can know the fund to support the building of the $185 million Australian-based engineering complex integration teaching facilities and research,

Let's look at  the Melbourne School of Design Building, the ultra-luxurious building of the School of Design. Isn't that gorgeous?

Now RMIT students can know why  the school building in your university can be spread all over the CBD?

They are all covered with your tuition!



However, the schools are increasing their tuitions every year!

At last, I must blame those Chinese associations in Australia, apart from organizing such superficial activities as playing Chinese lion dance, cuisine Chinese food,  spreading negative news on Chinese people, they did nothing to articulate positive aspect of Chinese people to Australia. Just like western social media, they focus on how Chinese people purchase more and more properties, how Chinese people snatch milk powder. They are possibly too dark inside their own mind that they cannot see any light outside!  Wearing a suit and tie,  speaking standard Aussie English with local people doesn't mean you are merged into the main stream!  As a Chinese people, we should articulate our voice to let the Australia society know our contributions!  Chinese student tuition is just an iceberg. there are variety of Chinese background people working in all industries in Australia and paying taxes to the government to support the construction of Australia.

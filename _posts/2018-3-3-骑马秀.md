We went to a stable in Victoria to enjoy a professional equestrian show.  This is a place called "Jilong Park"  and I guess it was purchased by someone from Hongkong, China from the traditional Chinese characters.  Actually it was not so crowded as I expected, but the performance is really awesome!  



今天我们到了一个叫“九龙马会”的地方观看了精彩了遛马盛况。我猜想这是被中国香港人买下来的马场，因为看到那个繁体字。本来以为人山人海，但是人并没我预料那么多，尽管如此，表演却是非常精彩。

The activity was divided into several episodes, there are youth equestrian showing,  hurdle jumping, and German coach professional show.  I have never seen so many wonderful blood horse in my life,  the sleek and oiled fur, noble-like temperament,  and mild personality. One of the cow-like horse was very wild and tamless that a teenager was thrown out of its back. Fortunately the ground is filled with thick sand. even a professional coach could not make it moving! It looked he was in a very bad mood today, so they have to take him away.  



本次马会被分成好几个部分，包括青少年骑马秀，跨越障碍，德国教练专业表演。我从未见过如此多的血统纯正的高头大马，那如丝绸搬光滑的皮毛，显然是焗油过的，那高贵的气质，还有温顺的性格。其中有一匹向奶牛一样的马，非常桀骜不驯，甚至把骑在上面的一个年轻人摔了下来，好在地面铺满了厚厚的沙子，即便是专业老师也驯服不了它，看来它今天心情不好，只能把它带回马圈。

An important thing we should note is we should not throw grass into the performance field otherwise the horse may take it as meal time and it would probably jump out of the fence and hurt people nearby.  



在观看马术表演时要注意，不要往里面扔草，它会以为是吃饭时间，搞不好要越过障碍，冲出来，那样会伤到人的。

The presider looked like a cowboy from Deksas state in U.S.A because his accent reveal his identity. The end show was performed by the coach from German, the dancing, jumping of the horse was harmonized by euphonic music, the coach was sitting elegantly on the horse's back, which formed an integrity and consistency of the man and the horse.



主持人的口音和他的打扮，像是美国德州牛仔。最后一场表演是来自德国的教练骑马伴随音乐在马场里来回溜达。给人一种音乐，人，马一体的感觉。
